// Fingerprint - The Fingerprint object provides detailed information about a digital fingerprint, which is a compact representation of data used to identify a longer piece of information, such as a public key or file content. It contains the algorithm and value of the fingerprint, enabling efficient and reliable identification of the associated data.
type Fingerprint struct {
	// The hash algorithm used to create the digital fingerprint, normalized to the caption of `algorithm_id`. In the case of `Other`, it is defined by the event source.
	Algorithm string `json:"algorithm,omitempty"`
	// The identifier of the normalized hash algorithm, which was used to create the digital fingerprint.
	AlgorithmId int `json:"algorithm_id"`
	// The digital fingerprint value.
	Value string `json:"value"`
