// Identity Activity Metrics - The Identity Activity Metrics object captures usage patterns, authentication activity, credential usage and other metrics for identities across cloud and on-premises environments. Example identities include AWS IAM Users, Roles, Azure AD Principals, GCP Service Accounts, on-premises Active Directory accounts.
type IdentityActivityMetrics struct {
	// The timestamp when this identity was first observed or created in the system. This helps establish the identity's age and lifecycle stage for risk assessment.
	FirstSeenTime int64 `json:"first_seen_time,omitempty"`
	// The timestamp when this identity last successfully authenticated to any system or service. This differs from `last_seen_time` as it specifically tracks authentication events rather than all activities.
	LastAuthenticationTime int64 `json:"last_authentication_time,omitempty"`
	// The timestamp of the most recent activity performed by this identity, including authentication, resource access, or API calls. This is the most comprehensive indicator of identity usage recency.
	LastSeenTime int64 `json:"last_seen_time,omitempty"`
	// The timestamp when password-based authentication was last used by this identity. This helps distinguish between password and other authentication methods (MFA, SSO, certificates) and identify password-specific usage patterns.
	PasswordLastUsedTime int64 `json:"password_last_used_time,omitempty"`
	// Details about the programmatic credentials associated with this identity, such as API keys, service account keys, access tokens, and client certificates used for automated access.
	ProgrammaticCredentials []*ProgrammaticCredential `json:"programmatic_credentials,omitempty"`
