// Vendor Attributes - The Vendor Attributes object can be used to represent values of attributes populated by the Vendor/Finding Provider. It can help distinguish between the vendor-provided values and consumer-updated values, of key attributes like `severity_id`.<br>The original finding producer should not populate this object. It should be populated by consuming systems that support data mutability.
type VendorAttributes struct {
	// The finding severity, as reported by the Vendor (Finding Provider). The value should be normalized to the caption of the `severity_id` value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the source.
	Severity string `json:"severity,omitempty"`
	// The finding severity ID, as reported by the Vendor (Finding Provider).
	SeverityId int `json:"severity_id,omitempty"`
