// EPSS - The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) object describes the estimated probability a vulnerability will be exploited. EPSS is a community-driven effort to combine descriptive information about vulnerabilities (CVEs) with evidence of actual exploitation in-the-wild. (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.first.org/epss/'>EPSS</a>).
